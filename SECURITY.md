# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

JetTreeMark is maintained and supported on the latest release version only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While JetTreeMark does not handle sensitive data, security is still important.

If you discover a potential security issue:

- Please report it privately by opening a confidential issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/HichemTab-tech/JetTreeMark/issues) with the **"Security"** label.
- Alternatively, you can email me directly if needed (contact details on GitHub profile).

We will review and address any valid concerns as quickly as possible.

## Scope

Since JetTreeMark only reads and displays project folder structures locally inside IntelliJ IDEA:
- No network connections are made.
- No project files are modified.
- No user data is transmitted or collected.
