# FAQ

## Where does the copied tree go?

When you click the **Copy Tree** button, the formatted structure is copied directly to your system clipboard. You can paste it anywhere (Ctrl+V).

---

## Can I customize how the tree looks?

Not yet — but planned!  
In future updates, you'll be able to adjust the style, indentation, symbols, and more.

---

## Does JetTreeMark modify my project files?

No.  
JetTreeMark is **read-only** — it only reads the structure and never changes your project.

---

## Will there be support for exporting the tree to a file?

Yes!  
Future versions will allow exporting the tree view directly into `.txt` or `.md` files.

---

## Is it compatible with all IntelliJ-based IDEs?

Currently tested mainly on (IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm).  
Support for other JetBrains IDEs (Fleet, etc.) is planned.
